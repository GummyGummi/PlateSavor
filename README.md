PlateSavor is a resturant finder WebApp built in HTML over the course of a few days. 
Uses OpenStreetMaps for the maps and OpenSourceRoutingMachine for pathfinding/routing. Uses Catpuccin-ish Dark theming with a hint of Material You for the UI. 
THIS WAS PARTIALLY VIBE CODED, ANYONE USING THIS CODE NEEDS TO CHECK FOR VULNERABILITIES. I WARNED YOU.
